=======================================
simple screen locker utility for X


I just migrated to slock from i3lock-fancy so nothing too creative on this build just yet. All that has been replaced are the default colors, which are as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------
static const char *colorname[NUMCOLS] = {
	[INIT] =   "#303030",     /* after initialization */
	[INPUT] =  "#11427E",   /* during input */
	[FAILED] = "#7d4c10",   /* wrong password */
};
-------------------------------------------------------

Might get more creative with this in the future, but for right now — let's pretend that it's all for #MiniMUHlism 😎 and not because I'm too lazy to write/apply patches for it 😬

------------
In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.


𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you're on Arch Linux you can also just run `makepkg -s` on this git directory and you might be able to just magically get an Arch Package build in this directory, albeit with a little bit of file redudancy

-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.

-------------
slock can be started after a specific period of user inactivity using xautolock. The command syntax is:

---------------------------------
xautolock -time 10 -locker slock
---------------------------------

Simpler alternatives to xautolock might be xssstate or my personal favorite, xss-lock.

Just use xss-lock…
